	<div class="oneFAQ">
		<button class="question">What should I expect from the Industry Panel?</button>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Ideally, weâ€™d like our panelists to share what led them to the computer science field and to their particular position in the company they represent. Professional tips, life advice, and career interests are topics that are also encouraged. The CS Kickstart organizers will prepare questions about your professional and personal experiences and then the panel will be open to questions from student participants.</p>
