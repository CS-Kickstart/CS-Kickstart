                  I was born in Taipei, Taiwan and moved into the Southern California in 1st grade. Though my official first name is "Yi Ju", I usually go by "Rita". Since I am in "engineering-undeclared", I am interested in exploring the various fields of engineering and computer science. Math and science classes have always been my favorite subjects. Rather unsurprisingly, I am involved in my high school's Math Club and Science Olympiad team as the president for both.

                  Hi everyone! My name is Ashleigh and I'm Filipino-American, born and raised in the Philippines. I attended an international school for thirteen years, and now I'm in the College of Letters and Science as an intended Computer Science major. I've been obsessed with computers and coding from a very young age (Neopets!), and since then it's become my dream to work for a company like Google or Blizzard (I'm a complete World of Warcraft geek). I'm also very interested in artificial intelligence, so it's likely that I'll add a double major in Cognitive Science.

                  My family calls me "hey you!" but everyone else just calls me "Deirdre" though some people have gotten a lot more creative than that. Although I was born in Manila, Philippines I'm a San Diegan at heart. My love for puzzles and mysteries developed my interests in math while this increasingly digital age has pleasantly pushed me into learning more about computers. As of now, I'm currently in the Letters and Science shooting for Business Administration at Haas but if that doesn't work out I'm planning on advancing my interests in Math.

                  Hello! I am from Victorville, California. I am excited for Berkeley and the CS kickstart program because it will be an entire different perspective for me since I live in the High Desert. I have a strong passion for anything related to computers. I have taken several computer courses in my high school and community college and it is one subject I can study for life. I have no experience in programming, but I am eager to learn. One of my hobbies include making videos by using Sony Vegas Pro 8.0. My intended major is computer science in the Letters & Sciences College.

                    Hi everyone! My name's Ilakya and I'm an EECS major! Having never lived outside of a five mile radius from Cupertino, I'd say that my interest in pursuing a career in technology isn't much of a coincidence; I've always been around and fascinated by technology! Aside from that, I enjoy doodling, reading, gardening, and consuming chocolate.

                    At heart, I'm an artist, but I recognize that I have other skills that could be honed in order to become a well-rounded individual; an individual who needs guidance to become both technically advanced as well as creative and thoughtful. In short, I think if I study computer science, I can meld the two fields together to create my own unique experience at Berkeley, and I believe this program can help me take a step in the right direction.

                  Hello! I was born in San Diego, California, but I spent five years living in Korea before moving back to SD to attend middle school and high school. At school, I was involved in track and field and I started a new chapter of DECA. I intend to major in either computer science or cognitive science. Originally, I thought I was heading towards the business field until I fell in love with CS in my computer science class just my senior year. My hobby is utilizing the wonders of the Adobe programs to design graphics and layouts, and I spend most of my time interning at a newspaper company and being the art director of a magazine. I hope to explore the fields of computer graphics, UI design, and human-computer interaction in more depth. I am so excited for August to come around!

                  I have lived in the SF Bay Area all my life and could not be happier to continue living in such an amazing and cultured environment for the next four years. I plan to major in Applied Mathematics at Cal, but I recently became very interested in Computer Science after one of my best friends introduced me to the world of programming. While at UC Berkeley, I also hope that I can continue dancing. Ballet has been a passion of mine for 13 years and I almost declined college to pursue a professional career in dance. Yet after meeting some truly intelligent and enthusiastic people at UC Berkeley I knew that this is where I wanted to be. Hopefully the knowledge I gain through the Kickstart program will help me succeed in my CS classes at Cal and potentially lead me to become a CS major!

                  Hello! My name is Alanna and I come from Milpitas, CA, which is between San Jose and Fremont in the South Bay. I am an incoming EECS major with no programming experience at all, but I would love to learn about computer science through CS Kickstart! Although I enjoy math and the physical sciences a lot, I also have a deep passion for history, centered more on U.S. History. My hobbies include reading almost anything, painting with acrylic paint, watching TV and movies, and spending time with my younger brother. In high school, the activity I enjoyed the most was tutoring people in math. It is something that I plan to continue doing up at Cal! I look forward to having a great time at CS Kickstart and meeting other Cal Bears!

                  Hi! I'm Allison Yee from Chino Hills, born and raised in Southern California. I'm planning to major in Computer Science in the College of Letters and Sciences at Cal. In high school, I was heavily involved in FBLA and the Photography Club. I love anything related to technology and aesthetics, including all types of design and fashion. You can always catch me poring through blog updates on my RSS feed, escaping into a novel, or watching something on Netflix. I've also had fun playing around with CSS and making blog-type layouts, but I haven't really programmed - so I'm extremely glad and excited to be a part of CS KickStart!

                  Hey everyone! I’m Amanda and I’m from North Reading, Massachusetts, a tiny little town north of Boston. I’ve spent my entire life in the North Reading but I’ve always wanted to move to California, so I’m really excited to attend UC Berkeley. I will be in the College of Letters & Sciences as an intended computer science major this fall. I don’t have much programming experience besides an introductory programming class I took in high school last year, but math has always been my favorite subject so hopefully that’s a start. And as for a little bit more about myself, I love music, coffee mugs, exploring new places, painting birdhouses, otters, dorky jokes, and playing tennis. I’m so appreciative of the opportunity that this program presents and I’m really excited to join the CS KickStart team!

                  I was born and raised in Iran but went to high school in Dubai. Ever since I was 13 I was fascinated by different areas of computer science especially artificial intelligence, because in Computer Science there is always room for growth. There is no limit to what you can do and where you can get to and that is what captured my interest. I am never able to put down a programming problem until I find the solution to it.
                  Although computer science is the source of my fascination, I have many diverse interests. I began playing the piano at the age of 7.I play sports such as badminton and swimming from quite early in my life. One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies from different genres and different countries. I love meeting people from new countries and cultures so this program is a great opportunity for me to pursue my passion and meet people who share this passion with me.

                  Hello, my name is Tanya and I am an upcoming EECS major. In high school, I was an active part of my school's orchestra and badminton team. I also sang Indian Classical Music, was part of an exchange program through which I went to Japan, and taught math in Kumon. I have always been interested in computers, so I decided to enter this field, but I ultimately hope to be a woman pioneer in the tech industry. Through this program, I hope to meet other CS/EECS majors and form a bond that will last my college years and more.

                  Three truths and a lie: I can have eccentric tastes and a wicked and sideways sense of humor. I enjoy the humanities and sciences alike, and look forward to wandering the gamut in the College of Letters and Sciences. I have dabbled in the area of computer science before, but CS Kickstart will be the first time I’ve actually taken a class. I’m a woman of many mysteries.

I love meeting new people and having interesting discussions so feel free to chat any time! I'll be an Engineering Physics major--if you know any other freshmen women in this major, please let me know (too much testosterone now...)! Other than copying and pasting code for an Arduino project in school, this will be my only CS experience so far, but I'm definitely excited! I love music, movies, tennis, leisurely hikes, and amusement parks. Somethings cool about me..hmmm...well this is kind of nerdy but I create really quirky mnemonic devices and love constitutional law (go Mock Trial pre-trial!). Can't wait to meet all of you :D

                  Hi! I'm from a small coastal town in central California called Morro Bay. I really dig gardening (puns), music, and creating art. My favorite bands are Angels & Airwaves, the Gorillaz, and Vampire Weekend. I love science fiction and watching films. Any film. I will watch it. I'm looking into CS because I know how versatile it is. My interests are incredibly broad so I wanted to explore a subject that could potentially flow into all of the things I'm curious about, things which include space, the environment, filmmaking, art, and biology. I also absolutely love to travel (my favorite two places that I have ever been are Scotland and the Galapagos). Can't wait to be a Bear!

                  Hi everyone! My name is Jenna and I'm from Sacramento. I'm super excited to be attending CS Kickstart and meeting other girls interested in the field of computer science especially at my number one dream school, UC Berkeley! At first I was scared of going into computer science because of my lack of experience in programming, but I knew that my interest in software engineering should overcome my fear. 
                  Some little things about me are that I'm very social. My favorite color is mint and my favorite TV shows are The Office, Parks and Rec, Greek, and Modern Family. I love to play volleyball and occasionally tennis, and I'm planning on starting yoga once I get to college. One interesting thing about me is probably that I have the biggest appetite known to mankind, which is a blessing and a curse. 
                  All in all, I am so excited to start off my college experience with a program like CS Kickstart!

I spent my senior year studying abroad in Massachusetts, and I cannot express how excited I am to be spending the next four years far from New England snowstorms. As you can tell, I'm not a winter person, and coming from a country where the Mediterranean climate keeps you warm all year round, I've always indulged in outdoor activities such as paddle boarding, horseback riding (You can always find me riding at the barn near my house), and playing tennis. I'm really interested in CS because I truly find it fascinating, and I see myself always pushing the limits of technology when I've graduated. I'm pretty much glued to my computer half the time, programming a bit, and watching one of the many, many TV shows I'm addicted to.

Computers and the Internet helped me branch out from a shy and timid child, and I hope my contributions to computer science aid in inspiring a new generation of children. In addition, I love that the field is versatile and that I can incorporate it with my interests, which include psychology, baking, community service and design. I also enjoy exploring, ice skating, being environmentally friendly, and watching documentaries!

I'm aiming for an L&S CS major but I don't have much experience in computers or coding except for a few self-learning attempts and HTML/CSS from Tumblr so I'm thankful for any help I get! I enjoy math/logic problem solving and hopefully computer science will be a possible future career. Some things about me? I love animals, especially cats, I got 2 of them at home. I am an avid listener of all genres of music from Kpop to alternative rock. I love playing video games.. like League of Legends and watching anime.. shamelessly it almost becomes a lifestyle. When I'm not glued to the computer screen, I play piano for fun or go for a run or swim. I am really excited to attend Cal and meet all of you this Fall!

                  I'm from Cupertino, California (Yup, Apple Headquarters) and hope to major in Computer Science or Applied Mathematics at Cal. Although I’ve been painting for as long as I can remember, I recently started playing around with 3-D modeling and graphics softwares such as Autodesk Maya and Blender. Seeing their applications intersect with what I’ve learned in calculus, physics, and Java first sparked my interest in computer science, especially computer graphics. I also play the violin, am a big fan of Thai food, and love climbing onto my roof to look at stars. I'm so excited to start my freshman year with CS Kickstart—I've heard lots of great things about the program and can't wait to meet everyone!

                  I am from Santa Barbara, a small beach town on the California coast, and will be attending Berkeley as an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major. EECS is such a new field and I am excited by the possibilities of where it could go. I have been playing piano since I was four, so it’s safe to say music has been a huge part of my life, whether it be classical music (my favorite period is the Romantic Period) or modern music (Vampire Weekend, AWOLNATION, and Lily Allen are some of my favorite artists). In high school, I became engrossed in mock trial, and I hope to continue mock trial at Berkeley. I love rollercoasters, frozen yogurt, and going to the beach.

I am not the most outgoing person, but I do enjoy having long, random conversations about anything that is NOT politics.  My hobbies include playing volleyball, drinking an exaggerating amount of water, making witty remarks, drawing, napping, and spending an unacceptable amount of time on the computer browsing the web and watching random cat videos on YouTube. As far as my CS background, I don’t have one, but I am eager to start my CS journey with CS Kickstart!  ?

You’ll often find me coming up with (semi-bad) puns, watching Ellen videos on YouTube, and racing in Mario Kart as the coolest driver Yoshi. I’ve been doing Chinese dance since first grade and hope to continue dancing in college (for fun). Regarding academics, I’ll be in UC Berkeley’s College of Letters & Science, where I’m excited to learn new things. Recently I’ve become particularly interested in Computer Science, as it seems to offer endless possibilities for creating things that help our world or are just awesome. I don’t have much Computer Science experience, so hopefully I can learn more about the field and develop some programming skills at CS KickStart. Overall, I’m excited to attend the program and look forward to meeting you all! Go Bears!

In 2012, I participated in a summer cryptography program at Stanford University. There, I had my first brush with proofs and coding. I walked out of the program knowing that I needed to learn Java or Python ASAP. In these coming years, I hope to study Applied Mathematics and/or Computer Science. I spend my free time sketching portraits, fangirling over Harry Potter, and fighting oppressive social structures.

I am interested in applied mathematics, architecture, politics, and environmental protection, which is no wonder I can't decide on a major. Now I am about to add computer science to the list. I have no experience with computer programming, but I am psyched to participate in CS KickStart. I use Google and my phone apps everyday without understanding how they were created. I want to understand programming and computers overall through CS KickStart. I love to read manga, watch criminal shows and cartoons, listen to dubstep, doodle, bake sweets, and eat.

I just recently became interested in CS because I realized how much bigger the world becomes when you have access to computer knowledge. I'm planning to major in Computer Science in the College of Letters and Sciences. Along with the many hours of studying Berkeley will surely require, in my free time, I plan on continuing my passion for bhangra, a Punjabi folk dance, playing badminton, sewing and fashion design. Something interesting about me, I guess, is that I'm exactly 5 ft tall, so I like to wear really high heels to make up for my height! The only experience I have with CS is the few lessons I took on codecademy.com so I'm looking forward to everything the CS Kickstart program has to offer!

Coming from San Gabriel in SoCal, my main interests were in the arts and languages, right until I took one Web Programing class that ignited my interest in CS. It wasn't until now however that I have really gotten the chance to pursue that interest. As the first in my family to go to college its difficult to take a deep breath and plunge into fields that for one, I haven't had much experience in, but mainly, don't quite resonate as they aren't predominately women or much less hispanic. I hope at CS Kickstart I will find that solidifying realization that CS is definitely for me and that I will build a foundation that will keep me a strong CS contender in my years at Cal.

I have always considered myself a STEM girl ever since I started playing Internet games (e.g. Club Penguin and Neopets) when I was little. From then on, I continued to develop my interests in math and technology throughout middle and high school. During senior year, I took an introductory computer science class, which sparked my interest in programming and designing software. Although I only have limited experience with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, I can’t wait to expand my CS knowledge at UC Berkeley, starting with CS KickStart. Outside of STEM, I was very active in Key Club, a community service organization, and I would love to continue volunteering throughout college. I also live up to my name, since I enjoy playing piano and participating in my church’s youth choir.

                  Hi everyone! I'm from Fremont, California, and I’m going to be a coming into Berkeley this year as a EECS major. I don’t have much programming experience but I’ve always thought that computer science would be an introduction into an exciting and abstract way of reasoning. In high school, I’ve been actively involved in Speech and Debate and DECA, which is a business and marketing club. I’m interested in public policy as well, especially the intersection of government and science as it pertains to national security. At Berkeley, I hope to join the Ultimate Frisbee team and audition for the Mock Trial team. Some of my favorite TV shows include Psych, The West Wing, and House of Cards. I’m incredibly excited to be starting off my Berkeley experience with KickStart!

                <p>
                  Hi! My name is Deborah, and I’m from the San Francisco Bay Area. I will be in the College of Letters & Science this fall, where I plan to major in Cognitive Science, and possibly double major in Computer Science. 
                  Computer science interests me because of its versatility—how it can be used in so many different fields. I hope that by gaining computer science skills I will have the ability to work in and explore many different subjects and disciplines.
                  My other interests include reading (especially novels, manga, and news articles), human geography, learning new languages, playing piano, singing, watching movies (particularly espionage movies), and cooking.
                  I’m really excited for CS Kickstart and UC Berkeley, and I look forward to meeting everyone!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mavey (MAY-vee), 17 years old. Born within San Jose, raised by San Francisco, China, New Zealand, Oakland, San Leandro, Salinas, and now expanding my horizons at Berkeley. Some life goals include making Computer Psychology a “real” major, joining the Google team, and studying abroad in outer space.

                  Would you believe me if I told you I was more excited when I learned about CS Kickstart than I was when I received my UC Berkeley acceptance letter?

                  Computer science is like martial arts and poetry; self-defense and self-expression. I feel like a superhero in training to save the world, acquiring the ability to defend myself and others in the technological universe. I think my fondness of poetry enhances my curiosity for coding. They are cousins in writing, requiring muse, creativity, and overcoming writer’s block. As a wordsmith of both worlds, it makes me happy to practice an art form I enjoy.

                  Hello, my name is Karen. I'm from Bakersfield, CA.   I am EECS major with some interest in double majoring applied mathematics. I am intrigued by computer science because I believe how computer works somehow correlates to how the world works.  Plus I like the title "Hacker" (not I want to be involved in  privacy infiltrating, Hacker just sound cool).  I read more about computer history than work on programming.  I play video games, watch cartoons/anime (Avatar TLA,FMA Brotherhood...), and I am a big fan of Chinese history/Wuxia Universe.

                  Hello lovely people! I am from a not so far off land called Murrieta, which is right in between San Diego and Los Angeles in SoCal. Currently I am in the College of Engineering, but I am undeclared so I am hoping CS Kickstart will provide me with some clarity. I also have no programming experience whatsoever, but I am ready to jump in head first. Some of my favorite things are cookie dough ice cream, long walks on the beach, and Led Zeppelin. I also play alto saxophone and have an undying love for Mock Trial. For now, I am just stoked to meet you all! Go Bears!

                  Since we can’t go through wormholes or black holes just yet, let’s build the future the realistic way, code by code. Excuse me, I’m “a little” obsessed with cosmology that kind of stuff: time travel, higher dimension, and multi-universe… Besides being a cosmo-worm, I also love dancing. Mainly ballet, but I also like hip-hop, jazz, and ballroom. I believe that the road to the future is paved by CS, that’s how important CS is. I might look quiet, but you can tell me if that’s how I really am once you get to know me.

I'm super excited to move to Berkeley; it feels kind of like an oven here for a significant portion of the year (we hit 119 degrees last month planes were canceled!). My dad was an electrical engineer and worked with computers a ton so he had me playing games like Scratch when I was little, which is what initially got me interested in CS. I stayed interested, obviously, once I realized how universally useful it is and I'll be majoring in EECS at Berkeley. In my free time, I tend to read a lot, mostly sci-fi/fantasy, but I also ran a hiking club at my high school which was really fun! We went out to different hikes on the weekends (at 4 am during the summer because you don't want to hike if the sun is up) and I hope to keep hiking at Berkeley, where the weather is nicer and I don't feel like I am going to melt.</p>

I'm from a suburban town called San Leandro, next to Oakland and fifteen miles from Berkeley. Currently I'm a declared cognitive science major, but there is a high chance that my interests might lead me to different pursuits during the next four years. Regardless, fields like artificial intelligence and virtual reality fascinate me, so exploring computer science beyond the AP Computer Science class I took senior year is definitely an endeavor I want to undertake! Beyond that, though, I enjoy watching Jeopardy at 7pm from Monday to Friday, cheering loudly and obnoxiously for the US National Soccer Team, eating (as long as it doesn't involve pickles), pondering sometimes existential questions, and writing anything from creative non-fiction to original short stories. </p>

One thing I do often is experiment with everything, even if it ends badly: when I was nine years old, I exploded a microwave while trying to make nacho cheese. Finally, while I do endeavor to pursue computer science as a career, my dream career and passion lies in becoming a professional Pokémon trainer.

I'm originally from Ames, IA, so I'm pretty desperate to come back to the land of actually green trees and cooler weather! I love film and graphic design, but I am also in love with physics, CAD, and the environment. Therefore, I'm hoping that my major in Architecture will combine everything that I am passionate about! My interest in computer science started when I created a website in third grade, and I have only been increasingly inspired by the ways that programming, AI, and technology can change the future. I hope this glimpse into CS will allow me to positively impact more people through efficient infrastructure and design of the future city skylines.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">Hi, I’m Jenny! I was born in Pleasanton, CA but spent most of my life in Austin, TX! Special talents include being able to read (and nap) anywhere, trying to learn several languages at the same time, and spending more time listening to and making music than not. I also love creating art and am very interested in exploring the intersections between art and tech. As someone hoping to major in Public Health, I aspire to employ computer science for humanitarian purposes, such as using epidemiological data to improve the healthcare of refugee populations. At Cal, I hope to volunteer and participate in STEM outreach because as a former Science Olympiad team member and Girls Who Code alum, I want to give back to the communities that helped me grow intellectually and emotionally. I have no doubt that CS Kickstart will be one of these communities as well! :)</p>

I have participated in FIRST Robotics for eight years--four years in FIRST Lego League, and four years in FIRST Tech Challenge (go FTC Team 8496!). Though I was exposed to computer programming through my time on the team, I am not the most well-versed in the subject. I decided to apply for the CS Kickstart program in hopes of gaining more knowledge and experience. I find learning about computer science to be not only interesting, but empowering as well. I spent my high school years competing at robotics tournaments and singing in various choirs at my school. In my free time, I like to draw, sing, listen to music, cook, and experiment with fashion and makeup! I hope that through this program, I will not only learn a lot about computer science, but also make great friends to start my college journey with!</p>

I'll be majoring in EECS so I'm looking forward to CSK and learning about the Berkeley CS experience. I first took interest in Computer Science through video games, because I was curious how they were developed. Taking the APCS course at my high school allowed me to discover that coding is more than just a few lines of characters, symbols, and numbers. In this class, I was able to combine CS with another favorite subject of mine, Physics, to create a light show to a song. At Cal I want to continue my interests in swimming and art, but also explore new things such as dancing. Can't wait to meet and code with all of you and start my college experience!</p>

I have been a competitive figure skater since I was 3 and hope to join the figure skating team at Cal. I can't wait to be a part of CS Kickstart and meet everyone! Go Bears!</p>

I don't have a lot of experience with CS, but I'm super excited to gain some through this experience with y'all. I think CS can be super useful in all fields and I'd like to use this experience to learn how I can specifically apply the skill to the medical field. If you like HSM, Harry Potter, dance, Khalid, post Malone, soccer, swimming, biology, sitcoms, Sherlock, or pretty much anything actually, we're gonna be hecka good friends. One of my goals in life is to understand as much of the human emotional spectrum as I can, and I work towards this constantly by having really great discussions with people around me and reading a lot. I'm super pumped to meet all you new people, and even more excited to see what we can push each other to accomplish. :')</p>

I became interested in computer science through a research internship in machine learning that focused on social/community-based Q&A and social media. In the future, I hope to delve into the intersection of medicine and computer science. I believe so many answers lie in the huge data sets available to us and CS provides a way to analyze and interpret this information in order to solve society’s greatest problems. Outside of CS, I am a springboard diver as well as a HUGE Game of Thrones fan! Looking forward to becoming cali gals with you all (:</p>

I'm looking forward to learning more about programming as part of CS Kickstart, and exploring the immensely vast field that is computer science. During my free time, you can probably find me planning what movies I want to watch but never getting around to watching them, as well as trying to find any excuse to hang out with friends. I like to say that I love baking, though I've never actually brought a pan of good muffins out of the oven. I also harbor an immense love for all things creative and aesthetic, such as stickers and anything that exists in pastel pink. My idea of a fun time consists of anything from off-key singing to radio songs to staying up way past midnight for no good reason. Congrats to everybody here and I look forward to meeting you all!</p>

I am super excited to meet everyone in August, and I cannot wait to explore and learn about Computer Science with everyone. I was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United States when I was 13 years old. Coming from a small town with limited technology for me to explore my interest in Computer Science, I truly appreciate this opportunity to learn more and prepare for the CS major at Berkeley, so that I am able to return to help my community. I enjoy collaborating on projects and solving problems with teammates. My hobbies are going camping and visiting natural sites. I am also a big foodie who loves to try different cuisines from various cultures. To me, a country’s cuisine says a lot about its culture, that is why I am thrilled to try all the rich flavors of our world.</p>

I like to say that I’m passionate about passion - when I’m surrounded by those that are enthusiastically pursuing what they love to do, I’m inspired to do the same, which is why CS Kickstart intrigued me. I can’t wait to be around those who are eager to learn and grow their Computer Science skills, a subject that, despite my limited knowledge, I am drawn to because of the perfect balance between logic and creativity - creating something out of nothing to enact tangible change! Other things I love include Broadway, picnics, Gossip Girl, and school spirit - Go Bears!</p>
